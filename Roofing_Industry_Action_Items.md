## 📊 Strategy & Messaging

### 6. Develop Roofing Industry Positioning
**Owner:** Lauren  
**Timeline:** Ongoing  

**Key Messages (from Terry's insights):**
- **NOT:** "We sell AI"
- **YES:** "We solve business problems with technology"

**Critical Cultural Understanding:**
- Roofing industry is **ego-driven** and **relationship-focused**
- Contractors trust experience over data
- Many started in the field or inherited family businesses
- Technology-oriented contractors exist but are minority

**Positioning Strategy:**
- Data **enhances** expertise, doesn't replace it
- Technology **supports** relationships, not threatens them
- Frame as: "Make you look even better to your customers"
- Focus on: Predictive maintenance = extended asset life = better customer relationships

**Target Message:**
> "Give your customers predictability and strategy, not just reactions. Use data to show them the path from C-rating to D-rating to E-rating, and help them make smart decisions before crisis hits."

### 7. Create Field Services Vertical Content
**Owner:** Lauren/Eli  
**Timeline:** Next 2 weeks  
**Status:** Started on website under "Field Service & Sales"

**Next Steps:**
- Consider dedicated roofing sub-page
- Emphasize key capabilities:
  - Voice data capture (hands-free, gloves-on)
  - Offline mobile apps
  - Photo documentation with auto-tagging
  - GPS tracking and geofencing
  - Real-time Salesforce sync
- Highlight deficiency-level tracking (not just work order level)

## 💡 Key Insights to Remember

### Industry Trends
- **Market shift:** New construction → asset life extension & preventative maintenance
- **Post-COVID impact:** Office/retail dying, malls closing or converting to condos
- **Current drivers:** Federal money for data centers, warehouses, energy projects
- **Architectural Building Index:** Bouncing between 46-51 (under 50 = market shrinkage)
- **Future outlook:** Likely downturn, focus will shift even more to extending asset life

### Technology Gap
- **Data organization:** Most companies track at work order level, NOT deficiency level
- **Huge opportunity:** Deficiency-level tracking enables predictive analytics
- **Terry's innovation (20 years ago):** "What's failing" + "Why it's failing" = predictability
- **Still not adopted:** Most of industry still doesn't do this
- **AI potential:** Can now automate the analysis and predictions Terry was doing manually

### Sales Approach (from Tom Persia/Terry)
> "You're not selling AI, you're selling solutions. To sell solutions, you need to do a deep dive into the industry so you understand their business and can solve their actual problems."

### Roofing Contractor Challenges
- Most are NOT technology-oriented
- Rely on personal opinion as "gold standard"
- Ego: "I've installed millions of square feet, I know when a roof will fail"
- Relationship-driven: "We build personal relationships, not data relationships"
- **Exception companies** (more tech-forward):
  - Kelly Roofing
  - Advanced Roofing (Rob Canerys & sons Kevin and Mike)
  - Best Roofing (Greg Wallock)
  - Kelly Roofing

### Software Vendor Landscape
- Most vendors focus on serving contractors (1 level down)
- Should focus on contractor's customers (2 levels down)
- Opportunity to differentiate by understanding end-customer needs
